**IDEA:** Recipe generator based on available ingredients

**WHEN:** I am a hungry person wanting a meal

**WHEN:** I don't know what I can make with what I have

**I WANT:** To find recipes I can make

**AND:** See what those recipes look like

**SO THAT:** I can make a meal with the instructions provided based on the ingredients I have
